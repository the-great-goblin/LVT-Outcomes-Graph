"Regulatory Need","Land Value Tax is simple and straightforward

Alternative taxation methods require more centralized involvement

More Bureaucracy and Waste
More Compliance and Enforcement
More Surveillance and Intrusion 

Obtaining accurate assessments is a challenge, but less so than the 
tracking, reporting, and inspection required  to make less optimal
 revenue streams such as income, sales, wealth, and property taxes work."
"Progressive Taxation

","Land Value Tax is inherently progressive in nature.
It cannot be passed on and falls heaviest on 
those who have more.

The VALUE of Land is concentrated among the wealthy.

The top 1% of households in the United States held 20% of all housing wealth
The next 10% held 35% of all housing wealth.
The Bottom 90% held 35%.

These figures were for the United States in 2012 but the relationship is similar across many advanced economies and the trend has only accelerated since.

"
Environment,"Environment

Nature provides massive value.

This value  is not created by any person and only exists
 due to the needs and potential of society. 

Allowing this value to be privatized means enriching some at the 
expense of others.

Capturing this value does not affect production

It would be far better as well as more efficient to ensure the value of 
exploited resources are used to benefit all of society while the 
privatized value is only that necessary to compensate for the finding, 
extraction, and bringing to market. 

"
Infrastructure,"Infrastructure

Public Infrastructure Increases Land Values

Much land value is the result of public infrastructure.
    Mass Transit
    Utilities
    Roads & Bridges
    Parks & Lighting
    etc


This forms a virtuous cycle of investment creating amore productive place commanding higher rents that can be collected to maintain the infrastructure and continually invest in new projects."
"Land Use","Everyone is a neighbor to everyone else.

Sub optimal usage of space has direct and indirect
costs for everyone.   

Tax structures and distorted incentives encourage 
misuse of space, even allowing some to profit from 
the inefficiencies.

There's a better way to lay out cities, towns and even 
rural areas.

Land Value Tax enables a healthy, vibrant ecosystem.

"
"Land Speculation","Land Speculators are a form of parasite.

Land values come from several vectors:
    - Public spending and availability of public goods
    - The productivity of the community 
    - Infrastructure and synergies from agglomeration

Very little comes from the work of the landowner.

A Land speculator is waiting for someone else to do
the work to make the land valuable and holding the
land hostage until someone is willing to pay the 
ransom.  
This is redistribution from the productive to the 
unproductive and it makes everyone
poorer."
"Real Estate Markets","Real Estate Markets are far from Ideal

- Returns to capital, labor, land should be in balance
- Market prices should be proportional
- Buyers and Vendors should have equal market power

Capital Growth in land is derived from Market failure.

Markets *should* result in the most efficient and 
equitable distribution possible but this does not 
describe a land market almost anywhere on earth."
"Balance Divides","Prosperity is not distributed

The differences in opportunity and quality of life
between global urban centers like London or 
New York  and hinterlands like the North East of 
England or Appalachia are striking.

Land values are related to these disparities, but they aren't merely a 
reflection. Much of these differences are driven by taxation
 methods and inequitable funding of public services.

Demographics is not destiny

Prosperous areas can be uneven, often because 
a disadvantaged group is restricted from 
access to land rents or provided less than their share
of public goods.

"
"Workers Unburdened","Many supposedly 'fair' taxes fall unfairly on workers.

Sales tax lies heavier on those who use a higher
 proportion of their wealth for goods purchases.

Income tax lies heavier on those unable to hire
accountants and lawyers to engineer their finances.

Payroll tax lies heavier on those who rely on honest
work instead of accumulation of assets.

Property tax is partially passed on to renters and 
homeowners through higher rents and property prices.

Tariffs and Excise tax are ultimately passed on to the
 consumer  and mostly benefit interest groups."
"Large Holdings","Overconsumption of Land is subsidized

Tax structures and subsidies give incentive to under 
use labor and over use land and capital.  

This leads to backwards market incentives.

Those with more land than they need tend to hold on to it.

Overly large operations prevent new entrants and 
distort credit markets. 

Yet larger operations in sectors such as farms are often
 less efficient."
Development,"The cost of finding and acquiring land is often prohibitive.

Holders of land expect to be compensated for the 
capitalized rental value.   
Finding financing for this is a significant impediment 
to entrepreneurs and productive business expansion. 

Someone trying to acquire land must in effect pay 
upfront many years of the equivalent annual 
Land Value Tax or find someone to finance it for them."
"Absentee Landlords","What's the value provided by a faraway landowner?

Absentee landlords have to hire someone local to 
oversee their property and manage tenants . . . 
Or just leave the lot bare.  

Either way housing and business costs increase for 
everyone who actually lives in the area and the value 
adding management is all done local.   

A Land Value Tax ensures that landlords will either 
add value or find another business."
"Underutilized Lots","Land speculation is more than just idle lots.

Many urban 'businesses' are not putting land to its 
highest and best use.  Often the business plan explicitly 
counts on the rise in land value underneath 
the business.  

Fast food drivethrus, convenience stores, parking lots, 
and many other seemingly productive businesses often 
make just as much if not more money from the long 
term rise in land value created by the community.  

This is a less visible, indirect, but very profitable 
method of leeching off of society.   "
Definancialization,"The high cost of housing gives outsize power to banks.

Mortgage lending is the largest category of debt in 
every advanced economy.  
In the United States, more than half of all lending is for 
real estate.   

Banks increasingly have shifted away from providing 
working capital and investment funds to businesses, 
they now primarily lend against pre-existing assets, 
in particular domestic real estate assets.

This precarious situation leads to booms, busts, and 
depressions.

Asset bubbles that grow large enough to drag down 
the entire economy usually have land and housing
 heavily involved."
Agglomeration,"Location Advantage = productivity gains.

Cities grow and develop because they provide residents
with advantage from proximity.

The overall effect of firms, workers, capital and 
resources  locating together results in synergies that 
increase productivity and reduce costs in complex and
unforeseen ways.

All Localized  productivity gains create higher rents.

These gains will show up in land values but are not the
creation of any single actor or group.  
Even further gains can be realized with better tax policy."
"Urban Sprawl","Spatial Misallocation is costly, unhealthy, and subsidized

The sprawling pattern of development is a natural
outcome of workers and business harnessing
transportation technology to escape high land prices.

But while living away from the city has its charms, it 
also has its costs.
    - Communities are insolvent so must be subsidized 
    - Growth and innovation is retarded
    - Health, happiness, and connection is lowered.
    - Environmental degradation is increased

A Land Value tax better aligns costs and incentives."
"Infrastructure Cost","Rational, compact development pays.

The costs to provide sprawling infrastructure is 
excessive and rarely makes financial sense.   Cities 
often take on significant debt servicing areas that will 
never recoup the costs to build and maintain. 

Collecting ground rent with a properly assessed land 
value tax gives insight on what scale of infrastructure 
investments a polity should be making.
"
Deadweight,"The entire economy and society is dragged down 
by  bad taxes.

Not only do goods and services become more 
expensive, but some jobs are never created, many
 transactions never take place, inventions are never
brought to market and landholding
 rentseekers charge an additional, private tax 
as gatekeepers to productive society.
"
"Choice of Sites","When land is cheap there is more opportunity.

With the cost of acquiring land reduced and less 
reason to hold land unproductively out of use, people
 and businesses will have much greater opportunity to
live and work where they would like, or even expand.

When improvements are untaxed there will be more.


With no tax punishment for more intensive use, 
property holders will provide more and better 
accommodations at already developed sites.  "
"Family Formation","Household decisions depend on  housing

Many life milestones are placed beyond reach by 
 housing costs.

'Generation Rent' has tried new strategies to deal with
the high cost of housing, but have foregone home 
ownership in many places and delayed starting a family.

This alienates new generations from feeling like full 
partners in society.

The implication for the future health of society is dark."
"Life and Work Space","Land markets don't care if you aren't interested.

Unlike commodities or other goods that can have a 
supply response, everyone participates in the land 
market involuntarily.   
Rising land prices tend to encourage more hoarding 
and speculation.  

It is not possible to completely forgo usage of land if 
you'd rather save money.  Even the homeless have to
sleep somewhere.

A Land value tax ensures that 'toll takers' who seek to 
profit from others gaining access to land without 
adding value themselves will exit the space.   "
"Investment Increased","Everybody wins with reduced investment in paper.

When real investment in goods, services, and labor 
replaces non productive investment in titles and rent
tolls, the effect on the economy will be dramatic.
  

Rising Land prices benefit less productive firms

Land holdings,even if not put into use  give preferential
 access to collateral for loans and leverage for
 interest rates."
"Pollution Decreased","The typical pattern of Sprawl is an ecological disaster.

Transport emissions are far higher than they would 
otherwise be as land is overconsumed and misallocated.

Ecological damage from deforestation, runoff, and 
disrupted migration and habitat zones are significant 
costs that become necessary when development is 
forced out to escape high land values.

Sprawl isn't just an Urban phenomenon.  
Taxcode driven overuse of agricultural land and 
underuse of labor requires both larger and larger 
holdings and employment of environmentally 
questionable pesticides and fertilizers"
"Privilege Priced","Those who receive advantages through no effort of 
their own will comparatively compensate others. 

Life outcomes in many US jurisdictions are determined 
by what zip code or school district one is born into.  

Residents of desirable areas receive comparatively 
more benefits from public goods and govt spending 
than those who live in less fortunate areas.

If they own land, they will on balance actually be paid 
for their good luck.

Prosperous and disadvantaged regions alike will have
their tax burdens balanced against benefits received."
"Public Funding","LVT is less vulnerable to unpredictable external events.

Income, Sales, and excise tax receipts are dependent
on local, regional, national and global economic trends.

Ground Rent cannot offshore, invert,  strategically 
dissolve, or be casualty of trade war.

  Land Value Tax is the most adaptable levy.

With no coercive effects other than efficiency, LVT
 allows the greatest adaptation and innovation in the
 face of economic shocks."
"Unjust Taxes","Taxes are necessary, but also distortionary.

Taxing things that people want more of, such as 
commerce, employment, goods, or ideas means there
will be less of them.

Collecting revenue from Land Value  instead means 
these 'bad' taxes can be reduced or eliminated."
Inequality,"One of the largest examples of wealth inequality is the value of land and housing.

Over the past 100 years land value has grown faster than bonds, equity, and even GDP.

In the United States in 2012, the top 1% held 20% of all land value.  The botttom 90% held only 33%. 
In Germany, 2014, the top 10% held 60% of all wealth in the country, with most of that being real estate.

Privatizing these rents presents an effecient but underappreciated method of redistributing wealth from the poor to the wealthy.  Few understand exactly how land value travels through an economy on a systemic level, but everyone feels the effects.   "
"Better Housing","Housing is intimately entwined with tax policy and its downstream effects. 

On the most basic level, taxing something means you will have less of it.  Property taxes that fall on structures mean fewer, smaller, and lower quality structures will be built and maintained.

Downstream of that, land speculation, monopoly and other economic incentives from leaving ground rent uncollected mean that there will be a constant mismatch between housing needs and housing supply.

A Land Value Tax makes it both difficult to profit from artificially constraining housing and removes the rationale for hindering development to match demand to supply."
"Prices & Rents","Land prices and housing rents are affected by market failures.  

So long as wages grow more slowly thanrents, It's impossible for housing to both be a good investment and affordable.

Private speculators chasing shifts in demand and owners seeking to protect the value of their holdings will exert pressure on market prices driving unaffordability and chaos up and down the market.  

A Land Value Tax will ensure the price to acquire land is matched more closely to the dynamics of local demand and allow natural growth and transitions while allowing non holders to gain entry without ransoming their future."
"Boom Bust Cycle","Land economics explain many of the forces underlying business cycles.

Shifts in ground rent lead to the creation of bubbles fueled by easy credit.  When housing inventory catches up to the demand bubble or credit dries up the price crashes and wipes out so much debt that the rest of the economy is dragged down.

The largest asset in every advanced economy is land, followed by buildings, followed by public infrastructure.  What people imagine are industrial or technology economies remain in a fundamental way land economies. 

Land speculation accounts for 60% of global capital investment.  Restricting the ability to profit from idle speculation in land will shift investment and credit from unproductive paper assets to productive wealth generating enterprise."
"Welfare Spending","Land monopolization, lack of access to housing, and  perverse economic incentives arising from  schizophrenic land and tax policies combine to create, intensify, or perpetuate a host of social ills that cost society much more to treat the symptoms of than it would to solve by striking the root.

By aligning incentives for landowners, developers, and workers social maladies arising from inequality and economic spatial mismatch would be greatly reduced and eliminate the need for constant supression of 'undesirable' effects springing from polices directly related to taxation and land."
Employment,"Some of the most straighforward effects of tax policy are on jobs, wages, and investment.

Taxes on wages leads to lower pay and less work.  Taxes on investment lead to less investment and entrepreneurship.

Subtly, few look beyond the reduced income after taxes to  consider the transactions that never took place, businesses that were never started, jobs never advertised, or shifts never worked because taxes made them never pencil out for decision makers.

Land Value Tax in contrast has no deadweight loss, has no effect on the supply of land, and only has stimulatory effects on production when properly assessed.  "
"Physical & Mental Health","Death and Taxes

 People forced to participate in an economic and legal system beyond their control will suffer on a number of metrics whether or not they are 'succeding' by the standards of the system.

Stress, overwork, pollution, environmental degredation, substandard housing, homelessness, hazardous jobs and poor nutrition are just some examples that will reduce quality of life from what it could be if tax and land use were more rational and citizens could engage with work and housing on more equal terms."
"Tax Evasion","Almost all tax policies are vulnerable to evasion
with enough incentive and motivation. 

Income and Wealth taxes should be renamed 
'Evasion Olympics'. The cost to administer them 
sometimes doesn't exceed the revenue collected.

Land is Different.

Land cannot be hidden, moved, or its ownership 
obfuscated.   If taxes are not paid, repossession is easy."
Conservation,"Environmental degradation is in many ways an economic problem: A common resource is consumed without the true costs being born by the consumers.  This applies to both land itself as well as natural resources extracted from or waste emitted back into the environment.

In many ways modern society has structured itself around the efficient utilization of capital and labor but wasteful utilization of land.  Interlocking layers of subsidies and externalities result in many issues that impact environmental quality: sprawl, transportation, speculation and more springing from poor usage of land and the ability of private actors to profit from keeping it that way.

A Land Value Tax would align the requirements of development and productivity with the need to ensure overconsumers of common resources pay instead of profit, and would allow for a community to structure itself in a truly sustainable way."
"Resource Rents","The value of natural resources are unfairly privatized.

The prices they command are a reflection of the wealth 
that can be created from their use and how much
 wealth society has available to purchase them.

This is such that holders of these rights receive  much
 more than the value they add by extracting, refining,
and bringing to market these resources. "
"Alternatives Encourged","Cheap land and natural resources price out innovation 

When the full cost of extracting and using natural
resources is born by society, but the value those 
resources create are privatized, there will be little 
incentive to develop and use alternate methods with 
a more efficient life cycle. 

Taxing this uncreated value properly aligns incentives

When society sees the true cost of over consumption
of land or resources consumers and policy makers will
begin to evaluate where alternatives make sense."
"Undevelopment Valued","Land should be developed to meet needs.

When land is not available to be speculated upon and
 held for profit unproductively, there will be little 
incentive to claim more than one intends to use.  

This aligns the interests of those who want to preserve
 the environment and those who want plenty of 
opportunities to grow and develop as needed.

The value of unmonopolized natural spaces will 
become apparent when the benefits of living and
working near such places are made possible."
"Marginal Land Left Wild","The value of unmonopolized natural spaces will 
become apparent when the benefits of living and
working near such places are made possible.

When housing needs are met and industry is able to
acquire space to operate and grow without having to 
pay a ransom to rentseekers there will be a consensus
that having 'wild' land not far from even urban centers
isn't anything unnatural.

It also provides a place of last resort for low productivity
persons to live and work as a sort of commons. "
"Leeches Lanced","Non producers will be unable to use their monopoly
 power to extract rents from producers.

Holders of landed assets will need to use them
productively at a level commensurate with the tax
or sell to someone who will.

Merely holding land for ransom in desirable locations 
or charging exorbitant rents for substandard housing
will be unrewarded.  

Secondary leeches who rely on exploitable low wage
 labor will find their work force more resistant to abuse."
"Producers Paid","Producers are compensated in proportion to their
contribution to society

When wages are no longer appropriated by rentseekers
through the monopoly power of landholding, the 
return to labor and capital will be comparatively higher.

Workers who earn a salary will have stronger bargaining
power and reduced pressure from rising rents.

Businesses and entrepreneurs who provide value will 
receive their full compensation and no longer have
 their production tolled by idle  rentseekers."
Entrepreneurs,"Commerce, Employment, and Innovation is held back 
when taxes change incentives.

Taxes on production and exchange reduce wealth and
productivity across the economy.

Taxes on wages and income reduce employment and 
savings.

Untaxed land is a drag on the entire economy due to 
higher rents for businesses and residents.

The most successful businesses become those who 
hold the most assets, monopoly power,  or are able 
to avoid taxes and regulation, not the most innovative, 
productive, efficient, or popular."
"Local Authority","In an ideal world, the closest authority should be able to evaluate and respond to local problems.

Land Value Tax is administered locally and requires knowledge of local conditions to work.  Decision makers and agents must be familiar with and interact with local communities and the particulars of each situation.  

The ability to respond to local conditions by local actors is not just a bonus, but a requirement. "
Overconsumption,"Those who take more of a shared resource in fixed supply than they 
need deprive others of opportunities.
 
The community will be  poorer overall: Those  prevented from 
access will suffer comparatively on a number of metrics.

Whether someone has good or bad reasons to consume more than 
needed of a common resource like land doesn't matter as long as those 
deprived are compensated for the loss of opportunity.

Those who over-consume will evaluate if it is really something they 
want or need."
"Use for Needs","Communities with suboptimal taxes often have suboptimal development

Decisions all too commonly are made to shore up the coffers of 
decision makers.

Often the change of use is one in which the authorities will be more able to 
assess and tax, regardless of what the people living in the community 
would need or prefer.

Businesses and workers often make decisions based on how much money 
they can bring in, often to be able to continue paying rent or service debt 
 rather than what the community and individuals actually want or need."
"Endless Growth","Rising rents and land prices cause urban areas to expand into suburbs. 
Suburbs to expand into exurbs.  
Exurbs into rural areas, and rural areas into wilderness.

A constant need to access affordable space is true for 
residents and business.

Governments want development and growth to keep income flowing,
shore up balance sheets, and expand powers.

Most of this is unnecessary with more rational land use and finance 
structures
 - Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell. "
Responsiveness,"Local institutions often do not have the resources to respond to 
problems they are uniquely placed to address.  

Unjust, inefficient taxes administered from afar exacerbate issues and 
local communities are blamed for problems that somehow 
are never solved.  There are then calls for action on a higher
level from more distant authority which may do more harm than good.

A land value tax would be administered locally and good practices 
would ensure institutions designed to deal with problems are 
resourced at appropriate levels without having to rely on outside 
funding or redistribution from those with no connection."
"Public Goods","When a place is well funded and serviced with 
quality infrastructure, a capable workforce, and good capital
 then investments that increase the safety, utility, and 
desirability of that place will start a virtuous cycle of 
increasing value and location advantage.  "
"Placed Properly","A significant drain on productivity and development is spatial 
mismatch between the assets and resources that fuel the 
economy on one hand and the workers and entrepreneurs 
that bring it to life on the other.  

One thick root of this sub-optimal land use would be torn up by 
collecting the value of land.

Once capital and labor are able to more effectively place themselves 
without holders or financiers of land asking for a cut there will be 
supercharged productivity and development."
"Like where you Live","Housing decisions are made under a number of pressures.

Balance must be struck between affordability, access to 
employment, amenities, social connections and  other factors.

Due to the effects of the Law of Rent quite often young or 
unskilled workers have to live somewhere less  than ideal.   
'Temporarily' until they get on the property ladder.

In Urban areas prospective homeowners are often told 
'Drive till you can afford it.' and  accept soul crushing commutes as 
a fact of life.  

There is no reason desirable neighborhoods cannot accommodate 
a wide range of incomes, lifestyles, and housing choices other than 
the fact that holders of land expect to be paid for the privilege of 
accessing it and enact laws to protect their 'investments'. 

A land value tax wouldn't magically make space for everyone to 
live where they like, but it would facilitate neighborhoods to adapt to 
demands of residents and accommodate a wider spectrum of
 wants and needs."
Improvements,"If you want more, tax less

There are two related contradictions in real estate markets.

1.) Developing Land with things people want increases the tax liability.

2.) Leaving Land empty and blighted reduces tax liability.  


These 2 contradictions work together to hold back natural turnover and
 contribute to stagnation and underdevelopment.

With an appropriate land value tax, properties will naturally change and 
adapt as communities grow and develop.   
Housing will be renovated and enlarged, proprietors will  respond to 
market forces and add value that benefits everyone. "
Productivity,"Productivity is more than just a factor of labor and capital inputs.


Land is the third distinct factor of production and when efficiently 
utilized without interference from rentseekers and private tolls the 
effect on output for the same inputs will be dramatic.

Laborers and thinkers alike will see a greater portion 
of return for work put in. In response they will boost their skills,
 efforts, and personal development.

Increased investment in productive technology and organization 
instead of non productive titles and scalping of natural opportunity
will lead to massive innovation.

Firms and individuals who used to specialize in privatizing rent will
 find profits decrease and turn to pursuits that contribute to 
productive enterprise.  "
